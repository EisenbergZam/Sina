# Introduction

This textbook primarily focuses on classical gravity, spacetime, quantum field, and the math that underpins these concepts. 

Since so-called “general relativity” does not truly rest on a fully general principle of relativity, we will commence our exploration with classical field theory before delving into selected topics in quantum theory. 

Please note that the book is currently written entirely in Chinese.

One could read preface.pdf for more details.
